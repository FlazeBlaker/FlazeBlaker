## About Me
I am a Computer Engineering student focused on building real-world backend and full stack systems. I enjoy designing scalable architectures, working on real-time systems, and developing AI-powered applications that solve practical problems. My work includes production-grade platforms involving payment systems, scheduling engines, and event-driven architectures.

Some production repositories are private due to active deployments and security considerations. I am happy to discuss architecture, implementation details, and system design during interviews.
