Hi, I’m Jay Pawar — Backend and Full-Stack Developer focused on real-time systems, scalable backend architecture, and AI-powered applications.

I build production-grade software including real-time scheduling systems, AI-driven platforms, and payment-integrated web applications.

Some production repositories are private due to active deployments and security considerations. I’m happy to discuss architecture and implementation details during interviews.
